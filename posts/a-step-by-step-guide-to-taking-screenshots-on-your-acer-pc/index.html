Additional Tips and Troubleshooting<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-additional-tips-and-troubleshooting>#</a></h2><p>Taking screenshots is a handy way of capturing what you’re doing on your Acer PC. To do this, you need to follow a few steps. First, press the “PrtScn” button on your Acer PC keyboard. This will capture the whole screen and copy it to your clipboard. If you just want to take a screenshot of your active window, press the “Alt” and “PrtScn” buttons simultaneously. Then, open Paint or any photo-editing program you have installed. Press “Ctrl” and “V” to paste the screenshot onto the program. Finally, click “Save As” and name your file whatever you want and save it. You’ve taken your screenshot!

How to Take Screenshots on an Acer PC<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-how-to-take-screenshots-on-an-acer-pc>#</a></h3><p>Taking a screenshot is a great way to capture information quickly. It’s especially useful when trying to troubleshoot a problem or just show someone what you’re seeing on the screen. If you’re using an Acer laptop, the process is simple. To take a screenshot on an Acer laptop just press and hold the ‘Fn’ key and press the ‘Print Screen’ (PrtSc) key. The captured screen will be saved in the ‘Screenshots’ folder, located in the ‘Pictures’ library. You can then open the screenshot image to view or edit it.</p><p>If you want to take a screenshot of just the active window, press and hold the ‘Alt’ and ‘Print Screen’ (PrtSc) keys together. This will capture the active window only and save it to the ‘Screenshots’ folder. To take a screenshot of a specific area of the screen, press and hold the ‘Ctrl’ and ‘Print Screen’ (PrtSc) keys together. This will open a small crosshair cursor that you can move around the screen to select the area for capture.</p><p>If you’re having difficulty capturing the screen, make sure that you’re pressing the correct combination of keys. If that doesn’t work, you can try using the ‘Windows + Print Screen’ (PrtSc) key combination. This will take a screenshot of the entire screen, but not save the image, so you’ll have to open Paint or a similar image editor to save it. Finally, if you’re still having difficulty taking a screenshot, you can try using the free Snipping Tool, included with Windows.</p><p>In conclusion, taking a screenshot on an Acer laptop is as simple as pressing and holding the ‘Fn’ key and pressing the ‘Print Screen’ (PrtSc) key. For more precise control, you can use the ‘Alt’, ‘Ctrl’ or ‘Windows + Print Screen’ keys. If these still don’t work, you can try using the Snipping Tool.</p><h3 id=2-troubleshooting-tips>2.
