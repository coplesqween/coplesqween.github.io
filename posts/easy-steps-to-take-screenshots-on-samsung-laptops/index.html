Select the screenshot that you just took and use the &lsquo;Edit&rsquo; option to make any changes such as cropping or adding text.</p><p>Finally, the last step is to save the screenshot. Click the &lsquo;Share&rsquo; option and select &lsquo;Save&rsquo;. You can also save the screenshot to cloud storage if you prefer. Once you&rsquo;ve saved the screenshot on your laptop, you can easily access it later.</p><p>These steps make it easy to take a screenshot on a Samsung laptop.
