These methods can be used to capture anything like an application window, the Desktop or an active game.
The first method to take a screenshot on Windows 8 Surface Pro is to use the Print Screen (PrtScn) feature. Press the PrtScn button on your keyboard to capture the entire screen and save it to the clipboard. After that, paste the image into any image editor and save it.
The second method involves using the Windows+PrtScn feature. This will automatically save a full-screen screenshot to the Screenshots folder located in the Pictures library. Navigate to the folder, select the image, then save it to your desired location.
Both of these methods make it easy to capture and save screenshots in Windows 8 Surface Pro. With a few simple clicks, you can capture anything on your device and save it as an image.</p><h3 id=2-using-the-snipping-tool>2.
