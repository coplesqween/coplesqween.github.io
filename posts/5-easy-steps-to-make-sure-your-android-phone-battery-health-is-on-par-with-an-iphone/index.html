It might seem like a daunting task, but don’t worry! Here are five easy steps you can take to ensure your Android phone’s battery health is in tip-top condition. If you and your friend’s are discussing about your phone’s battery health, and they have an iPhone and you just have an Android, then it is natural for you to worry about your phone not being able to perform as well as an iPhone. But there’s no reason to fret! Here are 5 easy steps to make sure your Android phone battery health is on par with an iPhone.\nGet an app to monitor your battery usage: With the help of a battery usage-monitoring app, you can keep track of the apps that consume the most power and reduce your usage of them.\nCharge only when needed: It is very important to keep your battery from overcharging. So, only charge your phone when you need it and unplug it when it is fully charged.\nKeep it cool: The battery temperature of your Android phone is more likely to be higher than an iPhone’s. To combat this, you should avoid exposing your phone to extreme temperatures.\nMake sure all the software is updated: In order for your Android phone to be on par with an iPhone, make sure all the software updates are up-to-date. This ensures that the phone is running in the best way possible.\nReplace your battery as needed: Replacing your battery every two years or so is an essential step to keep your phone running as if it were brand new.
