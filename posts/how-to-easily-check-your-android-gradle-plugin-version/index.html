Look for the plugin <code>com.android.tools.build:gradle</code> and you&rsquo;ll find the current version.</p><p>Third, you can open the Android Studio Preferences and navigate to the ‘Gradle’ option. You can find the version of the plugin in the window that opens up.</p><p>Finally, to update the plugin version, go to the Gradle pane. When you hover over the version number, a small tooltip with the ‘Update’ action will appear. Click it and the plugin version will be updated to the latest version.</p><p>These are the steps needed to easily check and update your Android Gradle Plugin Version. Follow these steps to ensure the plugins are always up-to-date with the most recent version.</p><h3 id=1-checking-plugin-version-on-android-studio>1.
