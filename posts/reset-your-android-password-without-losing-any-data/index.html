Resetting the Device<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-resetting-the-device>#</a></h3><p>Securing your device is an important step in keeping your data safe. One of the most common security issues today is forgetting a password and needing to unlock an Android phone. Fortunately, there are some steps you can take to recover your device without losing data.</p><p>The first step is to use Android Device Manager. This service allows you to remotely locate and lock your device, and you can also reset the screen lock if you wish. To access the feature, all you need to do is sign in to your Google account and confirm your identity.</p><p>If you aren&rsquo;t able to access the Android Device Manager, you can use the Find My Device application. This app requires you to install it on your device in advance, but once done, it can be used to unlock your device. After the app is installed, you will need to sign in to your Google account and download the application to get started.</p><p>Another option you have is to use a third-party tool. These tools are specifically designed to unlock Android phones, and they don&rsquo;t require you to sign in to your Google account. However, keep in mind that using third-party tools may not always be reliable, so ensure you use a reputable one.</p><p>Finally, if you can&rsquo;t access any of the above options, you can use recovery mode to reset your lock screen. This will reset your phone completely, so keep that in mind before you decide to use this method. However, as long as you have a backup of your data, you can easily recover it after the reset.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rTxa02a6GMs style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q: What is the process to reset your Android password without losing any data?
